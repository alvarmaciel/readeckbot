A Telegram bot that interfaces with a self-hosted [Readeck](https://readeck.org/) instance to manage bookmarks.

Features:

- /register (create a new user) or /token to register the bot with an existent user
- Save bookmarks by sending a URL (with optional title and tags).
- Read. Create a simplified version of the article in telegra.ph
- /md_<id> return the raw markdown
- /list  . unread articles 
- /epub generate an epub with the unread articles


## Setup a development environment

**1. Clone the bot repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mgaitan/readeckbot.git
cd readeckbot
```

**2. Download the Readeck binary**

Download the appropriate binary for your system from the official site: https://readeck.org/en/download

Unzip it and place the `readeck` binary **in the same directory as the bot code**.

**3. Start the Readeck API server in a console**

Open a terminal and run 

```bash
./readeck serve
```

or `readeck.exe serve` on Windows

This will start the Readeck backend on `http://127.0.0.1:8000` by default. 


**4. Set up your environment variables**

Create a file named `.env` in the project root. This file stores config variables used by the bot.

```env
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=<your_bot_token>
READECK_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
READECK_CONFIG=./config.yaml      # optional, can be left out
READECK_DATA=./data               # optional, use if you want to customize where data is stored
```

> ðŸ“„ Whatâ€™s a `.env` file? It's a simple file format for storing key=value pairs, that are loaded as [environment variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable) by apps. 

**5. Get your own Telegram bot token**

To connect your bot to Telegram, youâ€™ll need to create a bot and get its API token.

- Open Telegram and message [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather)
- Run `/newbot` and follow the prompts.
- Copy the token it gives you and paste it into your `.env` file under `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`

**6. Run the bot in development mode**

This project uses [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), a fast Python package manager and runner.

> Don't have it yet? Install it from here: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv#installation

Then run the bot:

```bash
uv run readeckbot
```

Thatâ€™s it! You can now start chatting with your bot on Telegram using your own token.


Happy hacking and happy reading! ðŸ“šðŸ¤–
